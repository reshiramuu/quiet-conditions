# quiet conditions 
This mod disables the particle effects associated with abilities like Rage which can be visually intense and overwhelming.
I have a feeling this will be an accessibility feature in future versions of the game!!

# Installation

### Thunderstore
The mod is available as a mod in the Thunderstore Mod Catalogue. This is the recommended way to install the mod.

### Alternate Installation
- [Install BepInEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html)
- Download the mod .dll from the **Manual Download** button on this webpage.
- Drag the "quiet conditions.dll" file into BepInEx/plugins directory. If the folder does not already exist, create one in your ATLYSS installation directory.
  - If using r2modman/Thunderstore already for other mods, which automatiically makes the BepInEx folder, the location of your ATLYSS mods can be found by the following steps:
